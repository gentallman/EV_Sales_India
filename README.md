The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a metric used to describe the mean annual growth rate of an investment or business metric (like revenue or sales) over a specified period longer than one year. It is a useful measure because it smooths out the effects of volatility and provides a consistent rate of growth.

```
CAGR = VAR NumYears = MAX('dimension'[fiscal_year]) - MIN('dimension'[fiscal_year])
RETURN
    IF(
    NumYears > 0, 
    POWER(
        DIVIDE([Last Year Sales], [First Year Sales]),
        1 / NumYears
    ) - 1,
    BLANK()
)
```
