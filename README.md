### Top Manufacturers in the EV Two-Wheeler Segment

![top_makers_2w_2023](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38121f49-8684-496c-9c6c-76a82d4dc7f6)
- In 2023, OLA, Okinawa, and Hero Electric emerged as the leading manufacturers in the two-wheeler EV segment. 

![top_makers_2w_2024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02fb2413-86f6-4ab1-bf8a-a56cb476e821)
- However, by 2024, there was a shift in the market dynamics, with OLA maintaining its top position, while TVS and Ather moved into the top ranks, indicating a competitive landscape and evolving consumer preferences.

### Bottom Manufacturers in the EV Two-Wheeler Segment
![bottm_makers_2w_2023](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d5812d6-7711-4dc3-a62d-26d61bb1c84f)
- In 2023, Jitendra EVs, Being, and Pure EV were among the lower-ranked manufacturers in the two-wheeler EV segment. 

![bottom_makers_2w_2024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/733a171e-5a19-4de4-857f-ed3ae068737d)
- By 2024, the bottom positions saw a change, with Battre Electric, Revolt, and Kinetic Green occupying these spots, highlighting ongoing challenges for certain manufacturers in gaining market traction.

### EV Penetration
EV Penetration refers to the market share of electric vehicles within the total vehicle population. It’s a measure of how deeply EVs have entered the overall vehicle market, typically expressed as a percentage of all vehicles on the road or within a specific segment that are electric.

__If out of 100 vehicles on the road, 10 are electric then EV Penetration is 10%.__

### Top 5 States with the highest penetration rate in 2024
![Screenshot 2024-09-07 172126](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dddbe36-27d1-4d8d-92ed-e965ad7fe071)
Two-Wheelers:
- Goa leads with the highest penetration rate at nearly 18% for EV sales in 2024, making it the top state in this category.
- Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Delhi also show strong penetration, contributing to a notable presence of EVs in these states.

Four-Wheelers:
- Kerala stands out with the highest penetration rate at 5.76% for four-wheeler EVs.
- Chandigarh, Delhi, Karnataka, and Goa follow, with an average penetration rate of 4.325%, indicating a significant market presence in these regions.

### Top Manufacturers Quarterly Growth 2022 to 2024 (4W) 

![4w_quarter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53ff9255-9393-433e-866c-7aa3bb20d709)
**2022:**
- Tata Motors led in EV sales with a steady increase each quarter.
- Mahindra & Mahindra exhibited a similar growth pattern.
- MG Motors achieved the highest sales in Q2 compared to other top manufacturer.
- Hyundai entered the market with approximately 26 sales per quarter.

**2024:**
- Tata Motors maintained strong performance with significant sales growth each quarter, peaking in Q4.
- Mahindra & Mahindra showed a reversed trend, starting with high sales of around 11K in Q1 but declining to 2.3K by Q4.
- BYD India had no sales in Q1 and Q2 of 2022 but increased to 715 sales combined in Q1 and Q2 of 2024, with an average of 366 sales per quarter.

### EV Sales and Penetration Rates Comparison with States

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498fed2f-4193-4e41-bc37-00e2367b7762" width="500">

- In Delhi, EV sales totaled approximately 46 thousand out of 606 thousand vehicle sales, resulting in a penetration rate of 7.71%. The dominance of two-wheelers in Delhi’s EV market is evident, making up 81.53% of EV sales compared to 18.47% for four-wheeler.
- In Karnataka, EV sales reached around 161 thousand out of a total of 1.58 million vehicle sales, yielding a penetration rate of 10.18%. The state’s EV market is even more skewed towards two-wheelers, which account for 92% of EV sales, leaving only 8% for four-wheeler
This trend may be attributed to the higher affordability and practicality of two-wheelers in densely populated cities like Karnataka.
	
### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40b224a0-5f31-4ea8-b65b-9bfaac23f8fc" width="400">

The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a metric used to describe the mean annual growth rate of an investment or business metric (like revenue or sales) over a specified period longer than one year. It is a useful measure because it smooths out the effects of volatility and provides a consistent rate of growth.

```
CAGR = VAR NumYears = MAX('dimension'[fiscal_year]) - MIN('dimension'[fiscal_year])
RETURN
    IF(
    NumYears > 0, 
    POWER(
        DIVIDE([Last Year Sales], [First Year Sales]),
        1 / NumYears
    ) - 1,
    BLANK()
)
```
### CAGR for Manufactures (2022-2024) 

![CAGR for Manufactures 2022](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5e44cee-7137-4a34-b2ff-e2e3d5cad267)
- OLA, TVS, Bajaj, Ather, and other groups have shown the highest Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). This indicates robust growth and increasing market presence in the two-wheeler EV segment over the past two year.

![CAGR for Manufactures 2024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e12d81fa-8364-492d-8a23-cb7cfb89af0c)
- BMW, Volvo, BYD India, Hyundai, and Mercedes-Benz AG are the top five manufacturers with the highest CAGR. This suggests that these brands have experienced significant growth and expansion in the four-wheeler EV market during the same period.

### CAGR for States (2022-2024) 

![imCAGR for States](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/839b8d34-2e30-46e2-8d02-b1f6068218ca)

- Growth Leaders: Meghalaya shows strong growth in both EV sales and total vehicle sales, indicating a robust overall market expansion. Goa also performs well in both categories, suggesting a growing interest in EVs alongside general vehicle sales.
- High EV Growth with Lower Total Sales Growth: States like Tripura, Nagaland, and Chandigarh show high EV sales growth rates but have relatively lower CAGR in total vehicle sales. This suggests a rapidly growing EV market in these regions, even if the overall vehicle market is expanding at a slower rate.
- Balanced Growth: Karnataka, Delhi, and Gujarat have notable growth in total vehicle sales but do not feature among the top states for EV sales CAGR. This may imply a more balanced market where the growth of EVs is proportional to the overall vehicle market expansion.
